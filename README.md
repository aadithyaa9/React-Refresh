This is my Review and Recalling of React 


This is SPA , built solely out of React.jsx

Made this simple react website to get in touch with the following hooks and props in react
  -> useEffect
  -> useState
  -> props

This is the basic revision for myself to keep my muscle memory of react in tact..

Will be deployed n vercel too.

If you feel , i have to add any other components or have to change something , feel free to issue

Tech Stack:
  -> ReactJS
  -> TailwindCSS
  -> API(for fetching and accessing the movie accessed by user)
  -

## Most Searched Movies
Also , I have Implemented a single search algorithm so that the most searched movies for a particular user comes at the top all the time

For Example , if my first 5 searches go like
  1) No Way Home
  2) Spider Man
  3) Spider Man2
  4) Amazing Spider Man
  5) SpiderMan xyz

Then the algorithm that i built increases the counter of all the words that has keyword of spiderman and displays that in top with the heading saying that ## Most Searched Movies
